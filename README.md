# D2DEventCollectionKit
Framework to track events in swift applications and transfer the data to the "D2D Event Collection" backend. 


### TODO: 
This is my list of things to to do, keep in mind and the minimum requirements. While development, this list will turn 
into a "real" readme file for external use. 


#### State of the Art:

- Cococa Touch Framework
- Objective-C compatibility (Prefix D2D)
- No external dependecies 
- As small as possible - Footprint of the SDK should be small
- Documentation 
- No typos in methods, comments and documentation


#### Testing:

- Compile against simulators
- Compile against devices


#### Code: 

- NSURLSession's for Networking


#### Distribution:

- Cocoapods
- Carthage 
- Swift package manager
